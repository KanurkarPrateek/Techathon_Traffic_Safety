# Traffic Safety:

### **Problem Statement:**

<aside>
üí° **‚ÄúDevelop an integrated solutions that identifies real-time traffic density and the problems that causes traffic such as potholes in urban areas, and heavy vehicles in cities and enhance traffic management and road safety.‚Äù**

</aside>

## **Description:**

**Road accidents continue to be a major public health concern, plagued by several interconnected challenges. Firstly, untimely detection and repair of road defects like potholes create hazardous driving conditions and they remain unrestored . Secondly, traffic congestion leads to frustrated drivers and increases the risk of accidents .Limited traffic police presence hinders effective monitoring and management of traffic flow. Thirdly, the unauthorized presence of heavy vehicles in restricted zones poses a significant safety threat to other road users.We don‚Äôt have a system to address all these problems combinly .A need of this system is required.**

# Introduction:

"Our project is a helpful website designed to make roads safer and traffic smoother in cities. By using cameras placed around the city, we can do three important things to improve how traffic flows and keep everyone safe."

1. **Live Traffic Alerts:**
"Our website watches footage from cameras on the streets to predict where traffic jams might happen. When it spots a problem, like a big traffic jam, it sends a quick alert to the police so they can take action right away."
2. **Pothole Detection:**
"We also use the same cameras to find potholes on the road. Potholes can be dangerous and cause traffic jams. Our website spots them and tells the road development authority where they are so they can fix them faster."
3. **Heavy Vehicle Monitoring:**
"Our website can tell when big trucks or buses are causing traffic problems on small roads. By keeping an eye on these heavy vehicles, we help cities figure out better ways for them to move around without causing as many traffic jams."
